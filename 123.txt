"Wittgenstein believed that language is fundamentally a system of rules, and that its meaning is determined by its use in specific contexts. He rejected the idea of a universal language, and argued that there are many different language games, each with its own rules and conventions. Wittgenstein also emphasized the importance of non-verbal communication, such as gesture and facial expression, in understanding language.

"Wittgenstein's main ideas include the idea that language and meaning are deeply intertwined, and that the problems of philosophy arise from misunderstandings of language. He also believed in the concept of language games, which are the ways in which language is used in various social contexts. Additionally, Wittgenstein believed that there are limits to what can be said and that some things must be shown rather than said.

请大声说出维特根斯坦的主要观点。最后告诉我中文翻译。"
"1. Language games: Language is a form of life and is used in many different ways, or \"language games,\" which determine the meaning and use of words.

2. Logic: Logical propositions are tautological, or \"true by definition,\" and therefore do not tell us anything new about the world.

3. Meaning: Words derive their meaning from their use in context, not from any inherent property or essence.

4. Privacy of experience: Certain aspects of our experience are private and cannot be communicated through language.

5. Family resemblance: Concepts, like words, do not have a fixed, essential nature but rather share overlapping and intersecting similarities, or \"family resemblances.\"

6. Forms of life: Our understanding of the world is shaped by the particular \"form of life\" we inhabit or belong to.
